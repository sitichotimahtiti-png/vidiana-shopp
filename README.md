VIDIANA SHOPP - Package

This ZIP contains a minimal frontend demo and starter files for the full-project scaffold.

WHAT'S INSIDE
- frontend/: React + Vite minimal app (demo)
- backend/: placeholder for Express backend
- db/: seed_products.sql
- public/logo-vidiana.png -> brand logo (replace with your original if needed)

HOW TO RUN (simplest, for users who have a computer):
1. Install Node.js and npm
2. cd frontend
3. npm install
4. npm run dev

HOW TO DEPLOY (from smartphone, recommended):
Option A - Vercel (easiest for frontend only):
1. Create a GitHub account (if you don't have). You can do this from your phone browser.
2. Upload this repository to GitHub (use GitHub website -> Add file -> Upload files).
3. Create a Vercel account and import the GitHub repo. Vercel will deploy the frontend automatically.

To use full features (orders, payments, chat) you need a backend and database (Supabase or Railway). If you want, I can guide you step-by-step to deploy backend from your phone.

REPLACING LOGO
If you want to use the logo image you uploaded in chat, replace frontend/public/logo-vidiana.png with your file (same name) and redeploy.

If you want me to prepare the GitHub repo and deploy to Vercel+Railway for you, tell me and I will prepare step-by-step instructions and the files you need to copy-paste on your phone.
